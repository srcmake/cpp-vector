# Vector Class Implementation

This simple project will contain a C++ implementation of vector. The things to focus on are 

The corresponding tutorial for this code will be [here](https://www.srcmake.com/cpp-vector) (when the code is completed).

## Files

- `srcmakevector.hpp` will contain our implementation of a vector class.

- `main.cpp` will contain our main function, which will use our vector class.

- `makefile` will be the make file used to run the code.

## Vector Checklist

- Basic vector functionality. (Create, initialize(n) (n, x). 
- push_back(), insert(), erase(), size().
- [] operator
- Destructor.
- Copy constructor.
- Copy operator.
- Move constructor.
- Move operation.
- Iterator.

## Todo List

Finish the vector class.

Write unit tests (maybe).

## Deployment

Simply type `make` in a terminal to run the project code.
